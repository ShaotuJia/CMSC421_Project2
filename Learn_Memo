This Memo is to record the experience during programming when made mistakes

1. Difference between json.dumps and json.loads

'json.dumps' is to convert 'List' to JOSN expersion

'json.loads' is to convert 'string' to JSON experssion

!!!!! Do not convert a List to string, and then use json.loads !!!!!!
!!!!! Do not use string for json.dumps !!!!!

In above two cases, there will be fail because the convertion generate many unknown "\\". 
These "\\" will cause failure when convert to JSON experssion
